The main purpose of this project is to:

* pay off technical debts - from me / to me - in terms of technical documentation 
* have a safe place for as much as possible for the case of disaster recovery
* have revisioned baselines for refinements, optimizations & evaluations of new stuff

for my home infrastructure components.
